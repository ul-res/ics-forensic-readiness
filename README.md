This repository provides the code used to run simulation experiments for the evaluation of the approach proposed in the paper "Forensic Readiness of Industrial Control Systems Under Stealthy Attacks".

First, add the files to your MATLAB path.

## Dependencies

Before running any of the tests, the following libraries need to be installed in the folder named 'lib':
1. YALMIP library (https://yalmip.github.io/) with the SDPT3 solver (https://www.math.cmu.edu/~reha/sdpt3.html);
2. the Truetime library (https://www.control.lth.se/research/tools-and-software/truetime/)

## Running the Tests

The experiments performed to evaluate the approach are divided into two parts:
1. In the first one, we test through extensive simulations of the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) whether our approach missed any relevant data, and we compute the average reduction in log size compared to the case where the logging of all data generated by the process is enabled. To run these tests, simply run the scrip `test_
